Fussy Eaters
=====================

This webapp looks for the recommended places and not recommended for the whole users group. Unfortunatelly I didn't have time to complete the users selection, so it's applying to all users.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Static Files

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.
